## 'Living Documents'

These pages are 'living documents', they will continually and iteratively be updated over time.

I cannot promise additional content will be added within any specific period of time, but I will be taking note of frequently asked questions, different use cases, and any issues encountered. These will be used to update and add to the existing content.

Similarly, following any of the sessions -- or if you were unable to attend the in-person workshops and are following along online - please feel free to email any questions: [alasdair.stewart@glasgow.ac.uk](alasdair.stewart@glasgow.ac.uk) or [katherine.keenan@st-andrews.ac.uk](katherine.keenan@st-andrews.ac.uk).

Note - we take absolutely no offense if your question is due to any of the materials being unclear! In all our time teaching, the most useful feedback we have received has been from students pointing out something that was unclear to them or raised further questions.
