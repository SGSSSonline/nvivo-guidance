### Session brief

This one-day in-person workshop is aimed at those with no experience of Nvivo, or those who would like a refresher. We will move through three topics:

The morning is led by [Dr Katy Keenan](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geography-sustainable-development/people/klk4/) will work through some basic tasks: 

- setting up a new Nvivo project 
- organising materials
- creating [cases](https://help-nv.qsrinternational.com/20/win/Content/cases/cases.html) and [case classifications](https://help-nv.qsrinternational.com/20/win/Content/classifications/about-classifications.html)
- manual coding 
- some autocoding features 

The afternoon is led by [Dr Alasdair Stewart](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/staff/alasdairstewart/) and will move to more advanced features and the flexible ways these can be used for qualitative analysis.  

Students will learn how to use some more advanced features of NVivo:

- coding workflows, tip and tricks
- different types of queries
- framework matrices

We will use some curated open access qualitative data (the Qualitative Election Study of Britain). However, there is an opportunity to discuss how to use NVivo to manage your own project.


### How can Nvivo help me? 

![](images/nvivo logo.png)

Nvivo is a software package for managing qualitative and mixed methods analysis projects. 

You can start an Nvivo project at any point in the research lifecycle: at the design phase, when you have already collected data, or even later. 

As an **analysis tool**, Nvivo can help you: 

- organise complex coding 
- manage your data sources 
- introduces a system of recording your work and coding - rigour and robustness 
- saves you time compared with manual coding
- help you visualize and cross-check data and coding 

But aside from helping to structure your  *analysis*, Nvivo can be really helpful as a **project management tool**, organising your data and other useful information in one place.

You can also use Nvivo to **collaborate** - you can share projects or using cloud functionality to invite others in. 

### And what can't it do? 
Important to note, using Nvivo will [NOT:]{.mark} 

- make your analysis better
- make meaning- you as the researcher do that 
- automatically provide objectivity and clarity, or ensure reproducibility 

Even though it allows linkage of qualitative and quantitative data, it **can't** perform quantitative analysis.

Nvivo takes time to set up; and to make the most of the software, it requires some patience. 

It is also more useful for some analysis approaches than others: for example very good for thematic content analysis (which we will cover today), but not so well adapted for others like interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA).
