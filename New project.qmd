### Create a new project in Nvivo 

Open NVivo and click the ‘New Project’ tile on the welcome page. 

If you already have a project open in NVivo, go to ‘File’ on the ribbon and select ‘New’. 
**Insert screenshot of opening a new project 


### Project settings 

The file name will be automatically generated. 

You can enter a description of the project at this stage as well. While not required, it’s good practice to include something here.

Choose your preferred save and recovery settings. 

NB: default settings are to have autosave disabled with save prompts every 15 minutes. If you turn on autosave, undo functions are disabled.

You will be prompted to take a quick tour, which will outline:  
  +	Importing data 
  + Cases 
  + Notes
  +	Queries
  + Visualizations 
  + Centralizing workflow

Skip for now – but may be worth coming back to in the future.
