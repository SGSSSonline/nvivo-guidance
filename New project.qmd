## Steps

### New Project

To create a new NVivo project file:

::: instructions

1. Open NVivo and click the ‘**New Project**’ tile on the welcome page. (If you already have an NVivo project open, click '**File**' on top-left of the ribbon and select '**New**'.

2. Give your project a suitable title.
3. The file name will be automatically generated. 
4. You can enter a description of the project at this stage as well. While not required, it’s good practice to include something here.
5. You can choose a language here - English (US) is the default.
6. Click **Next**.

### Save and Recovery Settings

Then, choose your preferred save and recovery settings:

> NB: The default setting is to have autosave disabled with save prompts every 15 minutes. If you turn on autosave, undo functions are disabled.

It's **VERY IMPORTANT** to save regularly as NVivo has a notorious habit of crashing. Whilst the autosave reminders can be annoying they are a minor annoyance compared to spending a day working on your analysis without saving for NVivo to unexpectedly crash!
