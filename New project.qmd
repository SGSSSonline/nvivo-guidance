### Create a new project in Nvivo 

Open NVivo and click the ‘New Project’ tile on the welcome page. 

If you already have a project open in NVivo, go to ‘File’ on the ribbon and select ‘New’ (step 1).

- Give your project a suitable title (2)

- The file name will be automatically generated (3). 

- You can enter a description of the project at this stage as well (4). While not required, it’s good practice to include something here.

- You can choose a language here - English (US) is the default (5)

- Click next (6)

- Choose your preferred save and recovery settings:

> NB: default settings are to have autosave disabled with save prompts every 15 minutes. If you turn on autosave, undo functions are disabled. 
It's VERY IMPORTANT to save regularly as Nvivo has a habit of crashing. 


### Optional tour 

![](images/optional tour.png)

You will be prompted to take a quick tour, which will outline:  

  + Importing data 
  + Cases 
  + Notes
  +	Queries
  + Visualizations 
  + Centralizing workflow

Skip for now – but may be worth coming back to in the future.
