## ðŸ¤” Project Structure

Within NVivo guidance and training you'll often see emphasis being placed on considering your project structure, such as:

- Use of folders to organise data, nodes, cases, and memos.
- Which case classifications to create.
- Auto-coding by speaker, style, and/or structure.

## Don't panic!

It is not a problem if you have already started your analysis and not added some of the ways to structure a project file covered in this session.

1. Most - such as auto-coding and creating folders - can be created at any stage.
2. Not every project needs to use all of these structuring options, and there is some 'aesthetic choice' in which to use.
3. If your transcripts do not make use of headers to structure the main topics covered, you can still do manual 'broad-brush' coding. (If having this topic-level coding would benefit your analysis!)
