Nvivo is a software package for managing qualitative and mixed methods analysis projects. 

You can start an Nvivo project at any point in the research lifecycle: at the design phase, when you have already collected data, or even later. 

As an **analysis tool**, Nvivo can help you: 

- organise complex coding 
- manage your data sources 
- introduces a system of recording your work and coding - rigour and robustness 
- saves you time compared with manual coding
- help you visualize and cross-check data and coding 

But aside from helping to structure your  *analysis*, Nvivo can be really helpful as a **project management tool**, organising your data and other useful information in one place.

You can also use Nvivo to **collaborate** - you can share projects or using cloud functionality to invite others in. 

## And what can't it do? 

Important to note, using Nvivo will [NOT:]{.mark} 

- make your analysis better
- make meaning- you as the researcher do that 
- automatically provide objectivity and clarity, or ensure reproducibility 

Even though it allows linkage of qualitative and quantitative data, it **can't** perform quantitative analysis.

Nvivo takes time to set up; and to make the most of the software, it requires some patience. 

It is also more useful for some analysis approaches than others: for example very good for thematic content analysis (which we will cover today), but not so well adapted for others like interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). 

## Navigating online resources 

There are a plethora of online resources for Nvivo (of varying quality...). This can be overwhelming! 

After you've done this workshop, you should feel more confident at searching and using these. 

Where possible, we will sign post you to more advanced online tutorials.
