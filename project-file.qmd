In case the download link is not working (my university seems to randomly stop share links from working), there is a zip file containing the NVivo project file on Social as well. Use the next tab for instructions to download and extract the zip file.

## The Data Set



## Project File Overview



## Converting/Upgrading the Project

NVivo project files are 'forwards' but not 'backwards' compatible. This means that newer versions of NVivo can open project files created in older versions, but not vice versa.

Due to that, the project file provided was created in NVivo 12, which was the oldest version attendees said they were using in the sign-up survey.

If you are using NVivo 12, you can open the file and directly start working in it.

If you are using a newer version of NVivo or NVivo for MacOS, you will be greeted by a screen asking you to convert/upgrade the file:
