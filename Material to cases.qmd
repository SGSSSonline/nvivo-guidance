### Coding to a case - manual approach  


In this example project, we are most interested in people who have **both** a 2016 interview and took part in the 2015 pre-election FGDs. 

Now that we have established our cases, we will link the responses of the 14 people interviewed in 2016 with their data from the 2015 pre-election focus group.  

So, we will link the interview transcript of Walt:

with Walt's data from the focus group he took part in:

To do this, we need to go into  each focus group transcript, search for responses from Walt, and manually code this to Walt's case. 

#### **Steps to do this manually**

- Open the 2015 Dundee pre-election focus group in your Detail View, and have Cases, People in your List View. 

- In the focus group data, use Ctrl+F (find) to search for responses from Walt.

- Highlight the text and drag it across to Walt's case in the list view. NB. It may be useful to highlight the preceding moderator's question/prompt that Walt is responding to.

- You can double click on Walt's case to check it's been coded correctly.

- Then you would cycle through manually for all instances of Walt's response in the focus group transcript, then repeat for other participants. 


### Coding to a case- using autocoding  


- While this is quite accurate, doing this manually gets really repetitive!  

Luckily, autocoding can help speed it up. 

However, for this to work, you must remember to **format the transcripts appropriately** in Word before uploading them into NVivo. 

We will look at how to do this using our focus group discussions, and sort speakers to their cases. 

> IMPORTANT: format of transcripts is crucial here. To use this feature, you need to format your transcript with each speaker's name at the beginning of a line, without any preceding characters. The speaker name can be on the same line as the response or on a separate line above it, as long as it's at the start of the line. You can also use a table format with the speaker name in the left column and the response in the right. 

Our transcripts are correctly formatted so it should work :-) ! 


- Continue with Dundee 2015 pre-election focus group discussion file and select 'autocode' from the ribbon. 

- In the autocode wizard, select speaker name and click next.

- In the autocode wizard, input all the speaker names from the transcript. 

You can either scroll through the text and insert the names one by one, or you can make a list of all speakers ahead of time and copy them in one by one. 

As you insert each name, the relevant text following their name will change color throughout the transcript.

>NOTE above, as per the formatting, if the person’s name is mentioned at the start of a line as someone speaks,  it gets picked up as well. 

> This **isn't** what we want! 
> This highlights the importance of pre-formatting the transcript in Word so that autocode works as intended. 

- Press cancel to exit the autocode wizard. 

## 

Let's start the process again using a properly formatted transcript. 

- Open the Birmingham 2015 pre-election focus group discussion files and select 'autocode' from the ribbon. 

Notice that in the Birmingham transcript, every time a person speaks it is followed by a colon:

- In the autocode wizard, enter speaker names with a colon (e.g. ***Charles:***) and click next. 

- Select Next. 

- As we already have cases set up for the people we are interested in, select ‘add to existing classifications’, ‘people’ and select ‘finish’.

- Check results by clicking into ‘cases’ and you should see that for those cases you have just autocoded, they have a higher number of references.
