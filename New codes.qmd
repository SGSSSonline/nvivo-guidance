### Creating new codes

As you progress with coding, some headings may not correspond to our initial question guide. 

This is common- these may be questions that were added in later or discussion that came up unexpectedly in the conversation. 

An example of this in the Dundee transcript is the question header 'Subsequent Political Change' : 


****add highlight on the this screenshot 
![](images/Subsequent political change.png)

To code this to a new code, highlight the text, and use one of 4 methods: 

1. Type a new code into the bar after ‘Code to:’, then push ‘Enter’ 

2. Click the Open Circle after the bar to create the code and code highlighted text

> You can use this coding bar to code to existing codes as well. 
> Once you start typing in the bar, NVivo will offer you existing codes to select:

3. Right click and choose ‘code selection’, then you can create a new code

4. Yet another way is to drag and drop text into the open space below the codes to open a prompt to create a new code: 

***add highlighting

### Things to remember 


- Codes will sort themselves to be alphabetical – clear, direct, short codes are helpful 


- When creating a new code, think of your future self and any collaborators. 

**Always** include a description of what you think this code means and what should be included here.
