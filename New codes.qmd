As you progress with coding, some headings may not correspond to our initial question guide. 

This is common- these may be questions that were added in later or discussion that came up unexpectedly in the conversation. 

An example of this in the Dundee transcript is the question header 'Subsequent Political Change' :

### Top tips


When creating a new code, think of your future self and any collaborators. 


  + When naming codes, use clear, direct, short codes  

  + **Always** include a description of what you think this code means and what should be included here.
