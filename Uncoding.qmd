### Uncode when necessary 

If you’ve coded something incorrectly, you can **uncode text** in as many ways as you can code. 

After highlighting the text, you can either: 

-	select ‘uncode’ in the document ribbon or the coding bar; 

-	use the keystroke (CTRL+SHIFT+F9); 

-	rightclick and choose uncode.
