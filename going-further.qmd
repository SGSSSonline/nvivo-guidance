::: {.callout-note title="Section Overview"}
This section covers intermediate-advanced topics in using NVivo for qualitative data analysis.

Key to how the more advanced features will be covered is through considering them as flexible tools for 'additive analysis'. They add to the 'foundational' elements of your project -- your files, folders, nodes, cases, and notes -- providing ways to retrieve, review, and recontextualise data based on the aims of your analysis. They are part of the extended toolset for crafting various ways to organise, navigate, layer, and weave your analysis and data.

It is assumed, therefore, that you have followed the steps in the first two sections, including importing data, auto-coding by speaker / structure, creating nodes and cases, and doing basic coding.

A project file though is provided on Social with these already setup.
