### Create a new project in Nvivo 

Open NVivo and click the ‘New Project’ tile on the welcome page. 

If you already have a project open in NVivo, go to ‘File’ on the ribbon and select ‘New’. 
**Insert screenshot of opening a new project 


### Project setup 

Add a **project title**. 

The **file name** will be automatically generated, but you may want to adjust where this is being saved to. 

You can enter a **description of the project** at this stage as well. While not required, it’s good practice to include something here.

Next, choose your preferred **save and recovery** settings. 

NB: the default settings are to have autosave disabled with save prompts every 15 minutes, which is quite useful.  If you turn on autosave, undo functions are disabled.

### Optional tour

You will be prompted to take a quick tour of Nvivo, which will outline:  
  +	Importing data 
  + Cases 
  + Notes
  +	Queries
  + Visualizations 
  + Centralizing workflow

Skip for now – but may be worth coming back to in the future.
