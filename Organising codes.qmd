### Connections between codes 

After a few rounds of open coding, and some reflection as you along, some hierarchical structures might emerge. 

::: consider

Look at your open codes and ask yourself: 

  + Are there any common themes that might make a good ‘parent code’? 
  + Do any codes refer to a theme or idea that may be experienced in a number of different   ways (different sources, targets, circumstances, etc.)?
  + Are there any common categories that would be useful to think with across many codes and examples? 
  + Do some of your codes exist within a common theme that could become a parent code? 
  + Does it make sense to nest down, or create a new top code?

> NVivo jargon: top level codes are called **'parent codes'**; sub-codes are called **'child codes'**. 
  
### Hierachical tree coding

- As we've already shown you, you can create a new parent code and drag in existing codes as sub-codes
- You can also create new 'child nodes' i.e. subcodes of existing codes. 
- You can collapse codes by right clicking->copy- Merge into selected code

### Recommendations 

- For beginners, and at the very start of coding, 2 levels are probably enough
- More than 3-4 levels becomes unwieldy
