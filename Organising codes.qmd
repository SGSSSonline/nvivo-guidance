### Hierarchical tree coding

After a few rounds of open coding, and some reflection as you along, some hierarchical structures might emerge. 

Look at your open codes and ask yourself: 

- Do any codes refer to a theme or idea that may be experienced in a number of different ways (different sources, targets, circumstances, etc.)?

- Are there any common categories that would be useful to think with across many codes and examples? 

- Do some of your codes exist within a common theme that could become a parent code? 

- Does it make sense to nest down, or create a new top code?
