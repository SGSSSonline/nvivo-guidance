title: "Synthesis, Intrepretation, and Themes"

::: consider

Within qualitative analysis you'll often hear terms like 'synthesis', 'interpretation', and 'themes'. At times this can vague and unhelpful, such as the over-used phrase claiming 'themes emerge' through analysis, without specifying precisely how.

We have though already covered some of the ways through which your analysis develops beyond the simple coding of text:

- Organising your coding within a code hierarchy, identifying broader parent codes and more specific child codes.
- Memos for exploring initial reflections and interpretation.
- Static sets and queries for exploring and refining your coding as your analysis develops.

Another useful feature for building synthesis, interpetation, and themes is framework matrices. Originally, in pen and paper days, framework matrices were often seen as an alternative to thematic coding, where instead of going through transcripts coding text, a matrix is created with rows for each participant and columns for the themes / codes. Information is then summarised for each participant for the columns, aiding in identifcation of patterns.

Within NVivo this is no longer an 'either/or' and 'both' is a valid option. Importantly, NVivo makes it possible to create a workflow for moving from coding to framework matrices.
