### What are 'Summary Links?'

Summary links are a framework matrix equivalent to memo see-also links. A summary link links text within a framework matrix cell to text within the transcript it is summarises from.

### Creating a Summary Link

Fortunately, the process for creating a summary link is more straight-forward and easier to remember than creating memo see-also links.

To create a summary link:

::: instructions

- Select text within a Framework Matrix cell (highlighted in blue).
- Select text within the Associated View (highlighted in black).
- Click the 'New Summary Link' button in the Ribbon bar.

### Navigating with Summary Links

Now try:

::: instructions

1. Change the 'Associated View' to 'Cell Coding'.
2. For one of the participants, write some quick summary text in two of the cells and create summary links between the text in the cell and the transcript.
3. Change the 'Associated View' to 'Row Coding'.
4. Within the cells click any of the text highlighted red (meaning it has a summary link) and the transcript will auto-scroll to the relevant section.
