See also links appear in red highlighting and, similar to Annotations, a panel listing all See-Also Links within the current tab can be displayed at the bottom of the page.

Importantly, if you right-click red highlighted text or any of the items listed in the See-Also Links panel, you can 'Open To Item'. This will open a new tab for the file that contains the linked text, and will auto-scroll to the exact section the linked text appears.
