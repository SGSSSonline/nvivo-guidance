### What Are 'See Also Links'?

'See Also Links' are a means to add a link between text across two different objects, such as text in a memo and text in a transcript. This makes it possible to write reflections on your coding and link directly to any text within the transcript you are directly speaking about.

### Creating a See Also Link

To link text within a memo to text in a transcript:

::: instructions

- Select the text you want to link to the memo text.
- Right-click and select 'Copy'.

### Viewing See Also Links

See also links appear in red highlighting and, similar to Annotations, a panel listing all See-Also Links within the current tab can be displayed at the bottom of the page.

Importantly, if you right-click red highlighted text or any of the items listed in the See-Also Links panel, you can 'Open To Item'. This will open a new tab for the file that contains the linked text, and will auto-scroll to the exact section the linked text appears.
