### Memos in NVivo

Memos within NVivo as basically rich-text files contained within your project file. They can be used for various purposes, such as storing additional project information, a log of analysis plans and what has been completed so far, and so on. One key use is to use them to store reflections about your coding. Importantly, it is possible to 'link' memos to any other object within NVivo, such as transcripts, cases, and codes. This means for each code you can create a link memo for it that can use to make reflexive notes as you code.

### Creating Memo Links


Create a linked memo for one of your chosen thematic codes:

::: instructions

- Right-click the code.
- Select 'Memo Link'.
- Then 'Link to New Memo...'

:::

::: instructions

Provide an appropriate name. For memos linked to codes I tend to go with "m - Code Name" naming convention.

:::

::: instructions

- Add headers for 'Example', 'Gold',' Unsure'.

### Combining Features

Now, you can use the coding matrix results we previously created to quickly find and read through content coded to both the code and these three organisation nodes. (Or, for time, add some lorem ipsum.)

This shows the power of NVivo that comes from 'combining features' into a workflow which may not be obvious and intuitive at first, but once you have a general sense of the features you will start to see various ways they can be combined for different stages and aims of your analysis.
