Create a linked memo for one of your chosen regular codes:

- Right-click the code.
- Select 'Memo Link'.
- Then 'Link to New Memo...'

Provide an appropriate name. For memos linked to codes I tend to go with "m - Code Name" naming convention.

- Add headers for 'Example', 'Gold',' Unsure'.

You can then use the coding matrix results to read through content coded to both the code and the three organisation nodes. (Or, for time, add some lorem ipsum.)
