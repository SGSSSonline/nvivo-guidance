## Remain Interview Participants

So, our next question was finding all our interview participants who support Remain the EU Referendum. As it is similar steps to follow, a shortened version of the instructions are included below.

### New Dynamic Set

::: instructions

Create a new dynamic set (right-click on 'Dynamic Sets' and select 'New Dynamic Set...') and provide it relevant Name and Description.

Then in 'Search Criteria' tab and 'Advanced' sub-tab:

::: instructions

1. Look for: 'Codes % Cases'
2. Interaction: "Code"
3. Option: "That Codes"
4. Value: "Select Items" & tick the checkbox next to 'Interviews (2016)' in the pop up dialogue.
5. By: "Any User"
6. Hit "Add to List"

Within the Select Project Item dialogue that opens:

::: instructions

1. Expand the People case classification.
2. Select '2016 vote' (the attribute to Remain/Leave in the EU Referendum)
3. Hit 'OK'

All that's left to do:

::: instructions

1. Change the 'Value' we are selecting for to 'Remain'.
2. Click 'Add to List'.
3. Hit 'OK' to create the Dynamic Set.

And again our Dynamic Set is shown in red and the results in green.

As you can see, once you start getting a sense for how to create search criteria, it becomes relatively quick for creating them -- most of the time spent is figuring out how to do it in the first place.
