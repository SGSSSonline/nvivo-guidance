## Remain Interview Participants

So, our next question was finding all our interview participants who support Remain the EU Referendum. As it is similar steps to follow, a shortened version of the instructions are included below.

### New Dynamic Set

::: instructions

Create a new dynamic set (right-click on 'Dynamic Sets' and select 'New Dynamic Set...') and provide it relevant Name and Description.

Then in 'Search Criteria' tab and 'Advanced' sub-tab:

1. Look for: 'Codes % Cases'
2. Interaction: "Code"
3. Option: "That Codes"
4. Value: "Select Items" & tick the checkbox next to 'Interviews (2016)' in the pop up dialogue.
5. By: "Any User"
6. Hit "Add to List"

### 2nd Criteria

Within the Select Project Item dialogue that opens:

1. Expand the People case classification.
2. Select '2016 vote' (the attribute to Remain/Leave in the EU Referendum)
3. Hit 'OK'

All that's left to do:

::: instructions

1. Change the 'Value' we are selecting for to 'Remain'.
2. Click 'Add to List'.
3. Hit 'OK' to create the Dynamic Set.

:::

And again our Dynamic Set is shown in red and the results in green.

As you can see, once you start getting a sense for how to create search criteria, it becomes relatively quick for creating them -- most of the time spent is figuring out how to do it in the first place.
