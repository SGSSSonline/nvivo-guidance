### What is a Coding Matrix Query?

A Coding Matrix Query finds all text that is meets conditions between two codes - such as text coded at Code A and Code B *or* text coded at Code X but not Code Y. You provide a list of codes to use for the rows, and another for the columns, alongside speciftying whether to use and/or/not condition between the two.

### Creating a Coding Matrix Query

First, ensure to have done some initial coding to the organisation codes:

::: instructions

- Select two or three existing codes from the top-level Codes folder or 'Autocoded (Theme)' sub-folder.
- Open tabs for to view the code results for each.
- Quickly go through coding sections from the code results to 'Example', 'Gold', and 'Unsure'.

:::

Then, to create a coding matrix:

::: instructions

- Go to the Query Criteria folder
- Right-click and select New Query
- and, Matrix Coding Query

::: instructions

- Rows = the regular codes you chose.
- Columns = Gold, Unsure, and Example.
- Hit 'Run Query'
- Remember to also 'Save Criteria...'

This will then produce a coding matrix you can then use to find sections coded at both a regular and organisation code.
