### What is a Coding Matrix Query?

A Coding Matrix Query finds all text that is meets conditions between two codes - such as text coded at Code A and Code B *or* text coded at Code X but not Code Y. You provide a list of codes to use for the rows, and another for the columns, alongside speciftying whether to use and/or/not condition between the two.

### Creating a Coding Matrix Query

First, ensure to have done some initial coding to the organisation codes:

::: instructions

- Select two or three existing codes from the top-level Codes folder or 'Autocoded (Theme)' sub-folder.
- Open tabs for to view the code results for each.
- Quickly go through coding sections from the code results to 'Example', 'Gold', and 'Unsure'.

:::

Then, to create a coding matrix:

::: instructions

- Go to the Query Criteria folder
- Right-click and select New Query
- and, Matrix Coding Query

Despite there being a **Queries > Coding Matrices** section, we do not use that for creating a new Matrix Coding Query. That section is where you can find the saved results from a Matrix Query. And the eagle eyed may have the following questions:

- There is a 'Query Results' section, so why also have a seperate 'Coding Matrices' section?
- You create a '*Matrix Coding* Query', but its results are referred to as a '*Coding Matrix*'?

The answer to both is 'Yes, but no idea why - that's just NVivo being NVivo'.

Then within the Matrix Coding Query:

:::instructions

1. Hit the '+' button.
2. Click 'Select Items...'

Within the 'Select Project Items' dialogue, select the three codes you picked:

::: instructions

1. Navigate to the folder containing them.
2. Check the boxes for them.
3. Hit the 'OK' button.

Repeat steps for the Columns with our organisation codes:

::: instructions

1. Hit the '+' button.
2. Click 'Select Items...'

Then:

::: instructions

1. Select Codes.
2. Expand the parent z - org code. (or name you chose for it)
3. Tick the boxes for the three organisation codes.
4. Hit the 'OK' button.

Finally:

::: instructions

- Hit 'Run Query'

Remember to also - 

::: instructions 

1. Hit 'Save Criteria...'
2. Provide a suitable name.

::: not-you

With some queries NVivo will ask you for a name upfront before letting you add criteria, with others you can modify criteria before saving - just always ensure if its a query you plan to reuse again in future to 'Save Criteria...' before closing the tab for it.

This will then produce a coding matrix you can then use to find sections coded at both a regular and organisation code.

It may not look that useful at first, is it not just a bunch of cells with numbers? 

Each number is a count of how many sections of text are coded for the relevant row and column codes for the cell.

Far more important though is double-clicking on any of the cells! That will open a Code Results view for all the text for that cell. So, if you click on the cell where row = campaign and column = Gold, it will open a results view showing all text coded at both campaign and Gold - in other words, all the text for campaign that we coded as potential gold for using as quotes when writing up.
