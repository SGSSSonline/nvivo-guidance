As an example of how flexible some of NVivos tools are, as with files, it is possible to autocode memos.

- Right-click the memo you created.
- Select 'Autocode...'

1. Change 'Under' to 'New Folder'
2. Provide it an appropriate Name
3. Hit 'Finish'

This may not seem like much with just a single memo, but if you had a series of structure memos this would let you quickly find and navigate them by specific sections.
