## Project Structure

::: consider

Within NVivo guidance and training you'll often see emphasis being placed on considering your project structure, such as:

- Use of folders to organise data, nodes, cases, and memos.
- Which case classifications to create.
- Auto-coding by speaker, style, and/or structure.

When first starting with NVivo, it may not always be clear why such importance is placed on these considerations.

Let's say you have the following series of questions during your analysis:

- How do I find the cases for all the interview participants?
- How do I find the cases for interview participants who supported Remain?
- How do I find what views interview participants who supported Remain had on the Leave campaign?
- How can I do an initial broad comparison of the views of Remain and Leave campaign supports?
