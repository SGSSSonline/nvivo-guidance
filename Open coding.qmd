### What is open coding? 

'Open coding' refers to inductive forms of coding, where meaning emerges from the data through the researcher engaging with the content and deciding to create a code. 

Codes are not pre-defined; they emerge through the analysis. 

ðŸ¤” Before jumping into open coding, letâ€™s consider: 


  + what themes we might expect to emerge from this dataset?  
  + what kinds of phenomena might be want to capture with open coding?

### Coding based on attitudes/emotions 

We know there are likely to be strong opinions expressed, so letâ€™s set up some attitude codes that we can quickly apply while reading the interviews: 

- Create a new parent code by either 1) selecting Create->code on the top ribbon or 2) right- clicking in the open space under the codes and selecting 'new code':

- Give this new code the title 'Attitude' (1), give it a rich description (remember your future self) (2), 

- Do not â€˜aggregate coding from childrenâ€™ for the attitude parent code (3), as we would seldom search for something including everything coded at any type of attitude. This can be toggled on later if needed, though.

- Create sub-codes within 'Attitude' for: 

  + Mixed
  + Negative 
  + Neutral 
  + Positive 

- To create a sub-code right-click an existing code and select â€˜new codeâ€™:

- You can see you now have a basic set of attitude codes to code to as you read the transcripts:

### Create new code based on ideas emerging in the data 


As you read, you may start to notice a key theme/idea/concept popping up throughout that doesn't fit into an attitude that you have pre-defined. You may decide that this deserves its own new code. For example, the theme of 'immigration' emerges repeatedly

- Create a new code for this in the same way as before... 


### Practice open coding 


- Spend some  time open coding by reading thorough the interviews in the 2016 interview folder. 

- As you go along, code to existing codes or make new ones for recurring ideas. Donâ€™t worry about going back and coding something that might not have occurred to you earlier in the interview or in previous interviews. 

> Remember that coding is iterative! and the same piece of text can have MULTIPLE CODES. 


### Reflexive coding 

- After reading a few interviews, take a break to revisit your codes. 

  + Are there any common themes that might make a good â€˜parent codeâ€™? 
  + is there something that stands out in your mind from reading that you donâ€™t see in your coding? 
  
> Donâ€™t be afraid to re-code the same section with more than one thing (e.g. you might code one comment as â€˜trustâ€™, â€˜Labour Partyâ€™, and â€˜positiveâ€™).

> Donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes â€“ you can always un-code!
