::: {.callout-note title="Session Brief"}
This one-day in-person workshop is designed for those with a basic working knowledge of NVivo for qualitative research projects. It is designed to introduce you to more advanced features and the flexible ways these can be used for qualitative analysis. It is designed as a follow-on from the "Introduction to Qualitative Analysis Projects in NVivo", but is open to everyone regardless of whether they attended that session.

Students will learn how to use some more advanced features of NVivo:

- coding workflows, tip and tricks
- using static and dynamic sets
- different types of queries
- framework matrices

We will use some curated open access qualitative data (the Qualitative Election Study of Britain). However, there is an opportunity to discuss how to use NVivo to manage your own project.

## Session Aims

### üßë‚Äçüéì NVivo 201 - Additive Analysis

...

### ü§î Problem-based approach

The sections and tasks for this session are based around problems and considerations to make you might encounter as your analysis progresses.

With each we will cover some conceptual points and a follow along demonstration that combines various NVivo features together to achieve an analysis aim.

The purpose of this is to explain features in context, the how and why you would want to use them, rather than just providing an abstract technical explanation of what they do.

Importantly, after the follow along demonstrations, we will have time for experimentation and discussion. I have tried to identify common enough problems and considerations that will be encountered across different types of project. However, all the steps and features covered can be combined and deployed in a multitude of ways. Please use the 'experiment and discuss' sections to raise any questions about how what we are covering could be applied to your project or recombined for other analysis aims.

### ü§¢ It's not you, it's NVivo!

NVivo is powerful and without a doubt better than analogue paper and pen analysis -- or worse, copying and pasting chunks of text into multiple Word/Excel files -- but it remains far from perfect. It is needlessly bloated and clunky, and historically had a reputation for regularly crashing.

The unintuitive design and labyrinthine steps required for some tasks -- never mind the joys of trying to recall them each time when first starting -- gives the false impression that it is all overly-complex. It might not seem it now, but with perseverance the pieces start fitting together, and the initial overwhelm will dissipate into mild frustrations.

To Lumivero's credit, the rate at which NVivo crashes has vastly reduced and is no longer a daily occurrence. However, it can still throw up the occasional unexpected error, freeze and lock-up, or decide to crash and die completely. This is most often 'NVivo-error' not 'user-error' -- there was not anything wrong in how you set up your project or actions you were doing, it's just NVivo being NVivo.
