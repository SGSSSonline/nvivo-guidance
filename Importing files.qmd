### Automatically create cases as you import (Windows only)

NB. The option to create cases automatically on import is available for Windows users only. Mac users, we will tell you how to create cases later. 

Next, a box will pop up:

If your Nvivo hangs or says 'not responding' when you import files, don't panic. This is normal Nvivo behaviour and usually resolves. It is a fussy program and if you have an older machine it can sometimes take a while to perform some actions. It does crash from time to time, which is why its important to save your work as you go.

::: {.callout-note title="What is a 'case' in Nvivo?"}
A [case](https://help-nv.qsrinternational.com/20/win/Content/cases/cases.htm) represents a unit of analysis, and this is most commonly people you've interviewed, organisations you worked with, communities, families, etc. In this example, cases are people that have been interviewed. But it could be any kind of unit: people, places, organizations, events or other entities that you want to analyze and compare. Cases allow you to link information together related to that person, place or organisation. It makes it easy for you to see everything related to a single unit in one place. See [the page on cases and case classifications](Cases.qmd) for more info. Not all projects require cases, but if you make comparisons across people or any other units, it's a good idea as opens up many other functionalities.
