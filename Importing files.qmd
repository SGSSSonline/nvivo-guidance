> What is a 'case' in Nvivo? 
A [case](https://help-nv.qsrinternational.com/20/win/Content/cases/cases.htm) represents a unit of analysis, and this is most commonly people you've interviewed, organisations you worked with, communities, families, etc. In this example, cases are people that have been interviewed. But it could be any kind of unit: people, places, organizations, events or other entities that you want to analyze and compare. Cases allow you to link information together related to that person, place or organisation. It makes it easy for you to see everything related to a single unit in one place. See [the page on cases and case classifications](Cases.qmd) for more info. Not all projects require cases, but if you make comparisons across people or any other units, it's a good idea as opens up many other functionalities.  

You will see your uploaded files appear in ‘Files':

You can see that cases have been created for these 14 people by scrolling down the left-hand menu to 'cases'; there you should see a case icon for the 14 people:
