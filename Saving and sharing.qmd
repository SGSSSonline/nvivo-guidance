### Saving the project 

If you followed the default settings, we have been saving our project as we go (every 15 minutes). 

To remind yourself where the file is saved you can go to: 

  File > Project Properties > General 
  
  and look at the location under File Name:  
  
  ![](images/save 1.png)

### Sharing with others 

You can easily email or share the project (.nvp file) with others. 

**REMEMBER:** There is forwards compatibility only. 

That means, as we are working Windows R1, it can only be opened in versions Windows R1, Nvivo 14 or 15. 

If you want to share with a mac user, you need to convert it before you share it. 

To do this, open the file tab -> Copy project -> Copy to, Nvivo (Mac), and choose a save location.  


This process may take some time. 

After the conversion is complete, you should have created a duplicate mac version fo the file in .nvpx format.
