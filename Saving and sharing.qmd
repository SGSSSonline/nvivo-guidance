### Saving the project 

If you followed the default settings, we will have seen pop-ups every 15 minutes to ask us to save. 

- To remind yourself where the file is saved you can go to: 

  File > Project Properties > General 
  
- and look at the location under File Name:

- If you click on the 'save and recovery' tab you can alter the frequency of saving.

- You also get the chance to set up a recovery option. This can be helpful if you are experiencing issues with Nvivo crashing.

### Sharing with others 

You can easily email or share the project (.nvp file) with others. 

**REMEMBER:** There is forwards compatibility only. 

If you created a project in Nvivo 14, you can only share with those using Nvivo 14 and 15, but not earlier versions. 

If you want to share with a mac user, you also need to convert it before you share it. 

- To do this, open the file tab -> Copy project

- Copy to, Nvivo (Mac), and choose a save location.

The conversion to mac and vice versa may take some time. 

After the conversion is complete, you should have created a duplicate mac version fo the file in .nvpx format.
