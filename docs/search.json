    "text": "Session Aims\n\nüßë‚Äçüéì NVivo 201 - Additive Analysis\nThis workshop covers intermediate-advanced topics in using NVivo for qualitative data analysis. Key to how the more advanced features are introduced is through considering them as flexible tools for ‚Äòadditive analysis‚Äô. They add to the ‚Äòfoundational‚Äô elements of your project ‚Äì your files, folders, nodes, cases, and notes ‚Äì providing ways to retrieve, review, and recontextualise data based on the aims of your analysis. They are part of the extended toolset for crafting various ways to organise, navigate, layer, and weave your analysis and data.\nIt is assumed, therefore, that you have pre-requisite knowledge in how to create and set up an NVivo project file, including importing data, auto-coding by speaker / structure, creating nodes and cases, and doing basic coding.\nA Project File though is provided with these already set up, and the follow along demonstrations will give a partial refresher on some of these. We can also use the experiment and discussion sections to do a short review of any of them.\n\n\nü§î Problem-based approach\nThe sections and tasks for this workshop session are based around problems and considerations to make that you might encounter as your analysis progresses.\nWith each we will cover some conceptual points and a follow along demonstration that combines various NVivo features together to achieve an analysis aim.\nThe purpose of this is to explain features in context, the how and why you would want to use them, rather than just providing an abstract technical explanation of what they do.\nImportantly, after the follow along demonstrations, we will have time for experimentation and discussion. I have tried to identify common enough problems and considerations that will be encountered across different types of project. However, all the steps and features covered can be combined and deployed in a multitude of ways. Please use the ‚Äòexperiment and discuss‚Äô sections to raise any questions about how what we are covering could be applied to your project or recombined for other analysis aims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄòLiving Documents‚Äô\n\n\n\nThese pages are ‚Äòliving documents‚Äô, they will continually and iteratively be updated over time. Please see the Callout on the About page\n\n\n\n\nüßü Slaying QDAS zombies\nTo say some qualitative researchers were initially resistant to qualitative data analysis software is an understatement. Early literature on the value of computing to qualitative analysis was filled with acerbic critiques, seeing software as undermining the rich in-depth analysis that qualitative analysis offers.\nThere was a partial truth to these criticisms as the nascent software was minimal in features and capabilities. What some critiques got wrong - or, at least, gave the impression of - though, was taking the limitations of the software as it was and treating these as inherent and inescapable.\nThe big four critiques - that software distances researchers from data by placing a barrier between them, strips qualitative methods of its diversity by homogenising coding and analysis, replaces the creativity of qualitative analysis with mechnical steps, and dehumanises participants by decontextualising their experiences - are not unavoidable dangers with modern software.\nHowever, the critiques unfortunately still persist as QDAS Zombies by being recounted again and again in the literature reviews of journal articles and books. That QDAS software is not overly friendly to new users - see below - unfortunately also keeps the zombie critiques going. When users struggle so much with the software that they find themselves turning to paper and pen ‚Äì or copying chunks of text into Word/Excel files ‚Äì it‚Äôs no wonder these critiques feel more alive than dead.\nWhat we will cover in this workshop should go towards dispelling that feeling by demystifying the features that help solve common problems and analysis aims beyond the basics. I‚Äôd go as far as arguing that once you gain a greater understanding and confidence in using contemporary qualitative analysis software, the zombie critiques are a greater risk when using paper and pen.\n\n\nü§¢ It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs NVivo!\nNVivo is powerful and without a doubt better than analogue paper and pen analysis ‚Äì or worse, copying and pasting chunks of text into multiple Word/Excel files ‚Äì but it remains far from perfect. It is needlessly bloated and clunky, and historically had a reputation for regularly crashing.\nThe unintuitive design and labyrinthine steps required for some tasks ‚Äì never mind the joys of trying to recall them each time when first starting ‚Äì gives the false impression that it is all overly-complex. It might not seem it now, but with perseverance the pieces start fitting together, and the initial overwhelm will dissipate into mild frustrations.\nTo Lumivero‚Äôs credit, the rate at which NVivo crashes has vastly reduced and is no longer a daily occurrence. However, it can still throw up the occasional unexpected error, freeze and lock-up, or decide to crash and die completely. This is most often ‚ÄòNVivo-error‚Äô not ‚Äòuser-error‚Äô ‚Äì there was not anything wrong in how you set up your project or actions you were doing, it‚Äôs just NVivo being NVivo.",

Since our launch in 2010, our aim has been to learn about the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of every day voters, before and after the UK general election. To this end, we hold focus groups and interviews, online and in-person. During this general election period, we want to hear your thoughts on political life in the UK. Whether it‚Äôs about the election, political leaders, parties, economic concerns, the NHS, or climate change, we want to hear it all.\n\nThe data is open access and available from the UK Data Service.\nFor more information on open research and data: - The FAIR principles to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital assets. - UK Data Service hub for archiving qualitative data and secondary analysis. - UK Data Service hub for data skills modules, covering research data management, data for reuse, and more.\nImportant to making data open access is storing it in ‚Äòinteroperable‚Äô, and ideally ‚Äòopen standard‚Äô, formats. Interoperable means that the files are not restricted to being opened by a specific single application. An open standard is one that is available for anyone to use, share, or access.\nFull ‚Äòopen research‚Äô remains limited within qualitative research for various reasons. Importantly, whilst there is an open QDPX format for sharing qualitative data analysis projects, it is a ‚Äòlossy‚Äô format ‚Äì where folder structures and more are lost when exporting to the open format.\nIn order then to avoid losing time creating an NVivo project file from scratch / tidying up an imported QDPX file, an NVivo project file has been set up for the workshop and available from Social. This project file is similar to what you would have had at the end of the Intro to NVivo workshop with a few minor tweaks.",

    "text": "Project File Overview\nAs a (very) quick overview of the project file:\n\nFilesCodesCasesNotesSetsQueries\n\n\nData &gt; Files\n\n\nFocus Groups (2015): Transcripts from three pre-general election focus groups from 2015.\nInterviews (2016): Fourteen telephone interviews on the EU Referendum in 2016.\nLiterature: Containing two articles by QESB team members, one on using grounded theory, the other on using focus groups.\nProject Files: With files that contain additional information about the project, the research phases, and participants who took part.\n\n\n\nCoding &gt; Codes\n\n\nCodes: Top-level folder with some initial coding created during the Intro to NVivo workshop.\n\nAutocoded (Sections): Sub-folder with the broad-brush themes that were created auto-coding the Headings within the interview transcripts.\nAutocoded (Themes): Sub-folder with codes created by auto-coding ‚Äòthemes‚Äô.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe have ‚Äúautocoded themes‚Äù within this document merely to provide a broad range of example codes to work with in the exercises. However, in practice, do not rely on such autocoding instead of creating and coding with your own codes.\n\n\n\n\nCases &gt; Cases\n\n\nInterviewer: Cases created when ‚Äòautocoding by speaker‚Äô that code transcript sections where an interviewer / moderator from the research team is speaking.\nParticipants: Cases created when ‚Äòautocoding by speaker‚Äô that code transcript sections where participants are speaking.\nCase Classifications: Top-level folder contains the case classifications and their attributes. For this project, there is only one case classification - ‚ÄòPeople‚Äô.\n\nPeople: Sub-folder with all cases classified as ‚ÄòPeople‚Äô, where can see the attributes for specific participants. (Note - the interviewer cases are also classified as people, in many cases you would want to remove from the same classification as participants.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemos: NVivo‚Äôs built-in note-taking system. Contains a few existing memos with further project info and reflectives on initial analysis.\nFramework Matrices: Create summaries for cases by node. Currently, empty.\nAnnotations: Annotations added to files, with couple examples.\nSee-Also Links: Use to link content/files to other content/files. Currently, empty.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic Sets: Manually created collections of project items, of any type. Think of this as a way to group and organise items for specific tasks without changing their primary structure. For example, a code can only exist within a single folder within the ‚ÄúCoding &gt; Codes‚Äù section. However, it can be included within an unlimited number of static sets.\nDynamic Sets: Collections of project items created based on search criteria. As they are criteria based they also auto-update based on any changes in your project. For example, if you had a dynamic set for all codes used to code focus group transcripts, each time you use a new code when coding the focus groups, it will automatically then be included in the dynamic set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVivo 12 - ‚Äòsearch folders‚Äô\n\n\n\nDynamic Sets are a new name given to what were called ‚Äòsearch folders‚Äô in NVivo 12. They operate exactly the same, all that is different is the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Criteria: Location to store saved queries, saving you from having to manually put them together each time.\nQuery Results: Location to store query results. This can be useful for more complex queries that take a long-time to process to save having to re-run it every time ‚Äì just remember it won‚Äôt reflect any changes to your project file. Query results can also be used to create new nodes and cases.\nCoding Matrices: Similar to the above but for the results of a coding matrix. By default manually created coding matrices saved results with be in Query Results, but they can manually moved across. Coding matrices automatically produced, such as when autocoding by theme, are stored here by default.",
