    "text": "Question codes - deductive coding\nAnother basic form of deductive coding is to use the interview questions themselves. It might be useful to know how everyone answered the same question across different transcripts.\nYou can view the interview questions and their suggested codes by going into the ‘Research tools’ folder and opening up ‘2016 Interview Questions’:\n\n\n\nCreating code categories- manual approach\n\nSet up codes based on question headers\n\nKeeping this file open in our Detail View, click on ‘codes’ in the Navigation View.\nCreate a new code by right-clicking in the List View section (currently empty)\nClick ‘new code’\n\n\n\nIn the pop up box, create codes from the terms in the right-hand column, one at a time. E.g. first off, make a code called ‘Intro’.\nFor this example, select ‘aggregate coding from children’ when creating codes. This means that subcodes under this code will be included when expanding this code and returned in queries using the parent code. This can be changed at any time.\n\n\n\nRepeat the steps for all the question codes until your list view looks like this:\n\n\n\nN.B. As we haven’t begun coding, both files and references will show as 0. Once we begin coding, the number under files will tell how many distinct files contain this code. References will tell the number of total times this code has been used (codes may be used several times in the same file).\n\n\n\nCode text manually to these question headers\nFor example,\n\nOpen the first file in the folder 2016 interviews\nFind the question header ‘Voting decision’.\n\n\n\nHighlight the text response within this section and drag and drop it into the code listed on the left.\n\n***add arrow\n\n\nN.B. Some headings may have a digit after them if it’s a code that’s occurring for a second time. E.g. there may be a ‘Referendum campaign 2’ heading. You could choose to make another coding category for this, but here we decided to code them all together into ‘Referendum campaign’\n\n\n\n\nCreating code categories- autocoding approach\nOnce again, this task is incredibly repetitive and is well suited to automation.\nAs before, you must ensure transcripts are appropriately formatted to take advantage of autocoding.\nMake sure that all question headers (e.g. Voting Decision’) are formatted in MS Word using the same style (e.g. heading 1’) . You are best to do this before uploading the documents to Nvivo. ****Finish this section\nhttps://qdatraining.com/auto-coding-using-structure-and-style-of-document/",

    "text": "Session Aims\n\n🧑‍🎓 NVivo 201 - Additive Analysis\nThis workshop covers intermediate-advanced topics in using NVivo for qualitative data analysis. Key to how the more advanced features are introduced is through considering them as flexible tools for ‘additive analysis’. They add to the ‘foundational’ elements of your project – your files, folders, nodes, cases, and notes – providing ways to retrieve, review, and recontextualise data based on the aims of your analysis. They are part of the extended toolset for crafting various ways to organise, navigate, layer, and weave your analysis and data.\nIt is assumed, therefore, that you have pre-requisite knowledge in how to create and set up an NVivo project file, including importing data, auto-coding by speaker / structure, creating nodes and cases, and doing basic coding.\nA Project File though is provided with these already set up, and the follow along demonstrations will give a partial refresher on some of these. We can also use the experiment and discussion sections to do a short review of any of them.\n\n\n🤔 Problem-based approach\nThe sections and tasks for this workshop session are based around problems and considerations to make that you might encounter as your analysis progresses.\nWith each we will cover some conceptual points and a follow along demonstration that combines various NVivo features together to achieve an analysis aim.\nThe purpose of this is to explain features in context, the how and why you would want to use them, rather than just providing an abstract technical explanation of what they do.\nImportantly, after the follow along demonstrations, we will have time for experimentation and discussion. I have tried to identify common enough problems and considerations that will be encountered across different types of project. However, all the steps and features covered can be combined and deployed in a multitude of ways. Please use the ‘experiment and discuss’ sections to raise any questions about how what we are covering could be applied to your project or recombined for other analysis aims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Living Documents’\n\n\n\nThese pages are ‘living documents’, they will continually and iteratively be updated over time. Please see the Callout on the About page\n\n\n\n\n🧟 Slaying QDAS zombies\nTo say some qualitative researchers were initially resistant to qualitative data analysis software is an understatement. Early literature on the value of computing to qualitative analysis was filled with acerbic critiques, seeing software as undermining the rich in-depth analysis that qualitative analysis offers.\nThere was a partial truth to these criticisms as the nascent software was minimal in features and capabilities. What some critiques got wrong - or, at least, gave the impression of - though, was taking the limitations of the software as it was and treating these as inherent and inescapable.\nThe big four critiques - that software distances researchers from data by placing a barrier between them, strips qualitative methods of its diversity by homogenising coding and analysis, replaces the creativity of qualitative analysis with mechnical steps, and dehumanises participants by decontextualising their experiences - are not unavoidable dangers with modern software.\nHowever, the critiques unfortunately still persist as QDAS Zombies by being recounted again and again in the literature reviews of journal articles and books. That QDAS software is not overly friendly to new users - see below - unfortunately also keeps the zombie critiques going. When users struggle so much with the software that they find themselves turning to paper and pen – or copying chunks of text into Word/Excel files – it’s no wonder these critiques feel more alive than dead.\nWhat we will cover in this workshop should go towards dispelling that feeling by demystifying the features that help solve common problems and analysis aims beyond the basics. I’d go as far as arguing that once you gain a greater understanding and confidence in using contemporary qualitative analysis software, the zombie critiques are a greater risk when using paper and pen.\n\n\n🤢 It’s not you, it’s NVivo!\nNVivo is powerful and without a doubt better than analogue paper and pen analysis – or worse, copying and pasting chunks of text into multiple Word/Excel files – but it remains far from perfect. It is needlessly bloated and clunky, and historically had a reputation for regularly crashing.\nThe unintuitive design and labyrinthine steps required for some tasks – never mind the joys of trying to recall them each time when first starting – gives the false impression that it is all overly-complex. It might not seem it now, but with perseverance the pieces start fitting together, and the initial overwhelm will dissipate into mild frustrations.\nTo Lumivero’s credit, the rate at which NVivo crashes has vastly reduced and is no longer a daily occurrence. However, it can still throw up the occasional unexpected error, freeze and lock-up, or decide to crash and die completely. This is most often ‘NVivo-error’ not ‘user-error’ – there was not anything wrong in how you set up your project or actions you were doing, it’s just NVivo being NVivo.",

    "text": "What are codes?\n\nCodes are tags or containers for complex qualitative data; they are a way to index, sort, link and interrogate data.\n\n\nThe process of coding data involves finding ways of summarizing key meanings within your data.\n\n\nRemember: the same piece of text can have MULTIPLE CODES.\n\n\n\n\nDeductive vs inductive coding\nIn deductive coding, you approach your dataset with a pre-established list of codes, often based off existing theoretical frameworks or even the research tools themselves (e.g. the questions that were asked). This is a more top-down, etic approach that is most useful for confirming or testing existing theories, or imposing organizational and structure into your file (e.g. coding by interview guide or research questions).\nConversely, inductive coding occurs when you allow codes to emerge from your engagement with the dataset itself, with no preconceived categories. This is a bottom up, emic approach to coding.\nYour own approach may be heavily influenced by your discipline, research aims, and research questions.\nHowever, most work will be situated in a hybrid space between the two.\n\n\nCoding as iterative\nSorry folks, qualitative coding is far from one-and-done. Coding is a cyclical, ongoing process. Interviews cannot be read and coded just once. As we re-read our datasets, we continue to develop new codes and subcodes, and refine our understanding of the data. Each time we read our material, we gain a deeper level of understanding each time we read our transcripts. With each pass, we will notice new things, which may prompt us to read new academic articles or ask different questions. This work will in turn shape what we see and understand in our next reading of the dataset. Nvivo can help us organise and interrogate codes but coding is led by the researcher.\n\n\nThe practice of coding\nRemember, when coding in Nvivo:\n\nCodes can overlap\nCodes will sort themselves to be alphabetical list – so clear, direct, short codes are helpful.\nConsider your future self (and any collaborators), and try to annotate your coding by always including a code description: what you think this code means and what should be included here\nCodes should change as your project changes. They can be combined and rearranged.\nDon’t be afraid to make a code because you’re uncertain if it will be relevant or important enough. They’re a tool to think with and can always be adjusted later.\nBe careful: try not to code when tired, bored, or distracted – you must always be actively thinking (the ‘organic computer’ [your brain] is the primary tool of analysis).\n\n\n\nAutocoding?\nYou might have heard about autocoding in Nvivo. Don’t worry- it is not advanced enough to replace the essential work of a researcher.\nThis is currently a basic - but often useful- functionality in Nvivo. It can help you organise the text into cases or themes based on pre-defined criteria (we’ll show you these below!)\nHowever it is the researcher’s job to interpret and make meaning from data.\n\n\nDifferent approaches to coding - learn more\nSee resources tab for more information about various approaches to coding.",

But it could be any kind of unit: people, places, organizations, events or other entities that you want to analyze and compare. Cases allow you to link information together related to that person, place or organisation. It makes it easy for you to see everything related to a single unit in one place.

    "text": "What is open coding?\n‘Open coding’ refers to inductive forms of coding, where meaning emerges from the data through the researcher engaging with the content and deciding to create a code. They are not pre-defined; they emerge through the analysis.\nBefore jumping into open coding, let’s consider as a group what themes we might expect to emerge from this dataset?\n\n\nCreating a structure for open coding\nWe know there are likely to be strong opinions expressed, so let’s set up some attitude codes that we can quickly apply while reading the interviews:\n\nCreate an ‘attitude’ code:\n\n\n\nN.B. Unlike other codes, do not ‘aggregate coding from children’ for the attitude parent code, as we would seldom search for something including everything coded at any type attitude. This can be toggled on later if needed, though.\n\n\nCreate subcodes for:\n\nMixed\nNegative\nNeutral\nPositive\n\nTo create a sub-code right-click an existing code and select ‘new code’.\n\n\n\nYou can also drag and drop existing codes into another code to make it a subcode.\n\n\n\n\nCreate new code based on ideas emerging in the data\nAs you read, you may start to notice a key theme/idea/concept popping up throughout that doesn’t fit into an attitude that you have pre-defined. You may decide that this deserves its own new code.\nFor example, the theme of ‘trust’ emerges repeatedly:\n****insert screenshot\n\nCreate a new code for this in the same way as before.\n\n\n\nContinue open coding\n\nSpend some more time open coding by reading thorough the interviews in the 2016 interview folder.\nAs you go along, code to existing codes or make new ones for recurring ideas. Don’t worry about going back and coding something that might not have occurred to you earlier in the interview or in previous interviews.\n\n\nRemember that coding is iterative! and the same piece of text can have MULTIPLE CODES.\n\n\nAfter reading a few interviews, take a break to revisit your codes.\n\nAre there any common themes that might make a good ‘parent code’?\nis there something that stands out in your mind from reading that you don’t see in your coding?\n\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to re-code the same section with more than one thing (e.g. you might code one comment as ‘trust’, ‘Labour Party’, and ‘positive’).\n\n\nDon’t be afraid to make mistakes – you can always un-code!",

A few examples:\n\nExample - Use for coding sections that are serve as illustrative example of another code.\nGold - Use for coding sections that have high probability of later being used as a quote. (Though ensure to avoid cherry-picking!)\nImportant - Use for coding sections that are important for the analysis. (This can be distinct in many cases from ‘Gold’.)\nUnsure - Use for coding sections that are coded to another code, but you are unsure whether either it is right code for the section or this coded section is making you question the overall code.\n\nIMPORTANT - You do not need all of these! This is merely showing range of examples. Which and how many to have wil change based on personal preferences and analysis aims. For example, when working as part of a large team, ‘example’ can be useful for researchers to identify coded sections they think illustrate specific codes they are developing. This can then help inform discussion to agree a share coding schema for the project.\n\nAnother way to use codes for organising is having codes to store excerpts you intend to use / have used in specific articles or thesis chapters. This can be combined with queries as well to aid finding most relevant sections. For example, a Matrix Coding Query with your writing organisation codes with your main coding schema.\nDue to the much more niche use-case for these codes, they are definitely ones to chuck in their own folder to avoid cluttering the top-level folder.\n\n\n\nCode Matrix Query\nFirst:\n\nSelect two or three existing codes from the top-level Codes folder or ‘Autocoded (Theme)’ sub-folder.\nOpen tabs for to view the code results for each.\nQuickly go through coding sections from the code results to ‘Example’, ‘Gold’, and ‘Unsure’.\n\n\n\nGo to the Query Criteria folder\nRight-click and select New Query\nand, Matrix Coding Query\n\n\n\nRows = the regular codes you chose.\nColumns = Gold, Unsure, and Example.\nHit ‘Run Query’\nRemember to also ‘Save Criteria…’\n\nThis will then produce a coding matrix you can then use to find sections coded at both a regular and organisation code.",

This was possible as the transcripts have Headings for each of the main topics covered in the interviews.)\n\nCreate Coding QueryCoding Query Criteria2nd Criteria\n\n\n\nFirst, click ‘Query Criteria’ in the left Navigation View.\n\nWithin the Details list you may see a message explaining what Query criteria are, if so hit ‘Close’.\n\nRight-click anywhere within the white space of the Details list, and:\n\nSelect ‘New Query’\n‘Coding’\n\n\nThis will open a new tab for creating a Coding Query. Similar to when creating Dynamic Sets in the Advanced view, we have ‘Search in’ options to limit our query to specific files, items, or folders (in blue). We also have rows for our search criteria (in green).\n\n\nWe what are our two main criteria?\n\nInterview participants who supported Remain.\nTranscript sections where they speak about the Leave Campaign.\n\n\nTo begin then:\n\nChange ‘All Selected Codes or Cases’ to ‘Any Selected Code or Case’.

So, all we need to do now is add another criteria for our ‘LEAVE CAMPAIGN’ code.\n\nClick the ‘+’ at the end of our first criteria to add another criteria below.\nChange the middle box again to ‘Any Selected Code or Case’\nClick the ‘…’ once more for a ‘Select Project Items’ dialogue.\n\n\n\n\nWithin the ‘Select Project Items’ dialogue:\n\nExpand the ‘Codes’ folder.\nSelect the ‘Autocoded (Sections)’ subfolder.\nCheck the tickbox for the ‘LEAVE CAMPAIGN’ node.\nHit ‘OK’ to confirm.\n\n\nNow you can hit Run Query (in pink) to check the query results match what we were expecting and Save Criteria… (in blue) so we can quickly access it again in future. As it is a fairly simple query and fast to run, there is no need to save a separate copy of the results.\n\n\n\n\nView Results\n\nNode ViewsOpen Referenced File\n\n\n\nAfter hitting ‘Run Query’ you’ll be able to see all coded sections that match our Code Query criteria. Just as when viewing regular Codes, there are three tabs on the right-hand side.\n\nSummary - provides a list of the interview transcript files with details for how many ‘References’ there are - in other words, how many coded sections within this transcript met our criteria - and ‘Coverage’ - what percentage of the total transcript is captured by the coded sections meeting our criteria.\n\nReference - is the default view when viewing Code results. It provides a view with all the coded sections, ordered by file they appear in. At the top, in the blue box, you can see it noting that the coded sections that follow are from the Cathy interview transcript, alongside the total references found and coverage. Then it lists each coded section in turn with info for coverage for that individual coded section, in green box.\n\nText - is similar to the ‘Reference’ view, but is like it’s ‘tab view’ equivalent. Rather than showing all the coded sections in a single view, it adds a row along the top for all the files, where clicking to select any listed file (in blue box) will change the main view below to show only the coded sections from it.\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, remember when viewing coded sections, you can right-click on any reference (in blue) and select ‘Open Referenced File’ to open the file the coded section is from.\n\nNVivo will open a new tab for the file, jumping to the specific coded section you had right-click on, and with a Coding Query will also highlight other coded sections from it in the file.",

We can see some of the familar elements again. In yellow we have the optiosn for searching across all Files & Externals or specific Items and Folders. In blue, we have the default ‘And’ for handling criteria - other options include Or, Not, and Near. What is different though is rather than adding 1+ criteria, we have a box for selecting Rows and another for Columns, in red.\n\n\nIt is possible to drag and drop items into the boxes for Rows and Columns, but it is often far quicker and more convenient to use the ‘Select Project Items’ dialogue.\n\n\nClick the ‘+’ underneath the Rows box on the left.\nFrom the two options click ‘Select Items…’\n\n\nThen within the Select Project Items dialogue:\n\nExpand the Codes folder.\nCheck the tickbox for the ‘Autocoded (Sections)’ sub-folder.\nHit ‘OK’.\n\n\n\nWe can follow the same process to select our columns.\n\n\nClick the ‘+’ underneath the Columns box.\nFrom the two options click ‘Select Items…’\n\nWhilst ‘Select Attribute Values..’ is an option, that is for selecting individual values with criteria (equals, does not equal) one by one. For our purposes, ‘Select Items…’ remains more convenient.\n\n\nSelect the ‘Case Classifications’ folder.\nExpand the ‘People’ case classification.\nExpand the ‘2016 vote’ attribute.\n\n\nAfter scrolling down a bit:\n\nCheck the box for ‘Leave’ attribute value.\nCheck the box for ‘Remain’ attribute value.\nHit ‘OK’.\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting our Rows and Columns, we can hit ‘Run Query’ (in pink) to create our Coding Matrix. Remember if you want to be able to quickly re-run and update the Coding Matrix to also hit ‘Save Criteria…’ (in green) and give it a suitable name.\nThe Coding Matrix itself (in blue) for each cell in the table shows how many coded sections intersect the two. So, the cell highlight (in yellow) is telling us that 15 sections coded ‘VOTING DECISION’ were also coded to cases, where the participant the case is for supported Leave (both in red).\n\nThat may not seem all that impressive at first. The real power of Coding Matrices though come from double-clicking any of the cells.\nThat will open a new tab showing all the coded sections being counted in that cell. So, for our example, it opens a tab showing all sections coded ‘VOTING DECISION’ AND also coded to a case where the participant supported Leave.\nThis makes a Coding Matrix the equivalent of a table of shortcuts to more specific queries. Since you can create them with classification attributes, it also makes them ideal for creating queries to aid comparison.",

    "text": "Summary\nThese examples show different ways you can iteratively build upon your project structure as your analysis progresses.\n\nYour initial structure (folders, codes, cases) can be used to create dynamic sets or query for specific coded sections.\nIt is possible to add layers upon layers. A dynamic set can be used as part of a query - saving you having to repeat the specific criteria for it again and again.\n\nIt can be useful then, in addition to considering your ‘foundational’ structure to think about which dynamic sets can add a supporting additional layer to make other tasks easier in the long-term.\nIt can feel slow and clunky at first getting to grips with creating them, but as you create more your pace will quicken, and through combining them with queries start to more intuitively combine NVivo features in relation to questions that arise during analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t panic!\n\n\n\nIt is not a problem if you have already started your analysis and not added some of the ways to structure a project file covered in this session.\n\nMost - such as auto-coding and creating folders - can be created at any stage.\nNot every project and analysis needs to use all of these structuring options. Some options also add equivalent structure in different ways, where there is some ‘aesthetic choice’ in which to use.\nIf your transcripts do not make use of headers to structure the main topics covered, you can still do manual ‘broad-brush’ coding. (If having this topic-level coding would benefit your analysis!)\n\nImportantly, for some project structure decisions there is no 100% right/wrong way to do it.\nIn the example covered we had a ‘Participants’ case folder, containing the cases for all participants, and used a dynamic set to get ‘Interview Participants’.\nAnother project structure may have case folders for ‘Interview participants’ and ‘Focus Group participants, and use a dynamic set to get ’All Participants’.\nNote, this would be feasible as long as the interview and focus group participants are two distinct groups. If some participants took part in both interviews and focus groups, then it would not be possible to have separate Cases folders for them, and the project would need to be structured similar to this example.",

Interoperable means that the files are not restricted to being opened by a specific single application. An open standard is one that is available for anyone to use, share, or access.\nFull ‘open research’ remains limited within qualitative research for various reasons. Importantly, whilst there is an open QDPX format for sharing qualitative data analysis projects, it is a ‘lossy’ format – where folder structures and more are lost when exporting to the open format.\nIn order then to avoid losing time creating an NVivo project file from scratch / tidying up an imported QDPX file, an NVivo project file has been set up for the workshop and available from Social.

However, in practice, do not rely on such autocoding instead of creating and coding with your own codes.\n\n\n\n\nCases &gt; Cases\n\n\nInterviewer: Cases created when ‘autocoding by speaker’ that code transcript sections where an interviewer / moderator from the research team is speaking.\nParticipants: Cases created when ‘autocoding by speaker’ that code transcript sections where participants are speaking.\nCase Classifications: Top-level folder contains the case classifications and their attributes. For this project, there is only one case classification - ‘People’.\n\nPeople: Sub-folder with all cases classified as ‘People’, where can see the attributes for specific participants. (Note - the interviewer cases are also classified as people, in many cases you would want to remove from the same classification as participants.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemos: NVivo’s built-in note-taking system. Contains a few existing memos with further project info and reflectives on initial analysis.\nFramework Matrices: Create summaries for cases by node. Currently, empty.\nAnnotations: Annotations added to files, with couple examples.\nSee-Also Links: Use to link content/files to other content/files. Currently, empty.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic Sets: Manually created collections of project items, of any type. Think of this as a way to group and organise items for specific tasks without changing their primary structure. For example, a code can only exist within a single folder within the “Coding &gt; Codes” section. However, it can be included within an unlimited number of static sets.\nDynamic Sets: Collections of project items created based on search criteria. As they are criteria based they also auto-update based on any changes in your project. For example, if you had a dynamic set for all codes used to code focus group transcripts, each time you use a new code when coding the focus groups, it will automatically then be included in the dynamic set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVivo 12 - ‘search folders’\n\n\n\nDynamic Sets are a new name given to what were called ‘search folders’ in NVivo 12. They operate exactly the same, all that is different is the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery Criteria: Location to store saved queries, saving you from having to manually put them together each time.\nQuery Results: Location to store query results. This can be useful for more complex queries that take a long-time to process to save having to re-run it every time – just remember it won’t reflect any changes to your project file. Query results can also be used to create new nodes and cases.\nCoding Matrices: Similar to the above but for the results of a coding matrix. By default manually created coding matrices saved results with be in Query Results, but they can manually moved across. Coding matrices automatically produced, such as when autocoding by theme, are stored here by default.",

Both of those votes had controversial and unexpected results: the 2015 Election was a surprise win for the Conservatives, and in Scotland, the Scottish National Party made huge gains over Labour. The 2016 EU referendum resulted in a 52% vote to leave the European Union, and this marked a change in the UK’s relationship with Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nThe data extract we are using allows longitudinal linkage because some of the people who took part in the 2015 focus groups later participated in a 1-2-1 telephone interview.\nThe data citations:\nCarvalho, E., Winters, K.

Referencing software might be better for managing academic literature. The same goes for video/audio files.\nIt is helpful to imagine how these things are best organised in a file hierarchy.\n\n\nWhat are the main units of analysis?\nThese could be individuals you’ve interviewed, organisations you’ve studied, communities you’ve worked in, etc. And you could have nested units at different levels (e.g. individuals nested in communities).\nThese units of analysis might later get created as ‘cases’ in the Nvivo project file, which enable you to keep information about that case all in one place.\nFor example, a case within a project file might represent an individual, with multiple linked interview transcripts, some fieldnotes, and some metadata telling of their demographics.\nThese cases and case structures can evolve as you conduct your research, too.\n\n\nWhat are the characteristics of these units?\nNow consider what characteristics of these units you have measured. For example, for individuals you have interviewed, you might have socioedemographic data recorded (e.g. age, sex, education) This would be known as metadata, and might be recorded in a spreadsheet or table.\n\n\nWhat are the linkages within the project?\nThis might be files that are linked within a single case or individual, for example an individual who has 2 sequential interview transcripts. Or, it might be linkages between different individuals or cases who live in the same household.\n\n\nWhat are likely to be key topics or themes?\nThis may be unknown at this stage, but you might imagine some key/core themes based on yoru research question such as ‘trust in institutions’ , ‘sense of loss’, etc.\nThese themes might become ‘codes’ within your Nvivo project."

We are trying to match this with our existing case classification of ‘People’, so we need to make sure it’s formatted the same way to enable it to match.\nSo check that:\n\nThe first column - ‘People’- indicate the cases. Check this is typed the same way in your Nvivo project setup.\nThe names in this first column should match the formatting of the cases and the interview file names in Nvivo - and this is case sensitive (i.e. if it’s vince it must also be ‘vince’ and not ‘Vince’)\n\n\n\n\nImport classification sheet\n\nFrom the Import ribbon tab, select ‘classifications’ and then ‘Import classification sheets’.\n\n\n\nSelect the ‘metadata.xls’ file from the ‘Research tools’ folder.\nClick Open to select file.\nThen click Next on the import Wizard:\n\n\n\nSet classification type as ‘case classification’.\n\nYou can select or deselect if you want to create new attributes, update existing classifications, or replace existing attribute values.\n\nClick Next.\n\nN.B. to set up ‘file classifications’, follow the same process but select ‘file classifications’ here (might include similar demographic info as well as things like location of interview, who interviewer was, time, date, etc.)\n\nChoose to represent files ‘as hierarchical names’; click next.\n\n\nSelect how you want blank attributes, dates, time and numbers to be represented.\n\n\nClick finish.\nNow, check that case info has been imported to existing ‘People’ classification. You can see that the first row of the excel sheet linked with the cases that already existed, and now you have columns indicating exactly the columns that were in the spreadsheet.\n\n\n*****UPDATE THIS SETCION TO DEMONSTRATE LINKAGES\n\n\nManually add new cases\nClick on the ‘cases’ on left hand menu, then right click on the open space in the ‘List View’ under your cases and select ‘New Case’, or use shortcut or Ctrl+Shift+N.\n\nInput any name / description for the case under ‘General’\n\nSelect relevant attributes under ‘Attribute values’\nSelect case classification as ‘People’\nYou can assign values from the drop down box for each attribute\n\nSelect OK.\n\n\n\n\nCreate new attributes for an existing case\nYou might want to create a new column in the metadata for a new feature that varies among your cases.\nWe are going to create a new attribute ‘2015 pre-election’ that indicates whether they also took part in the 2016 pre-election focus group.\nIn the Classification Ribbon, select ‘New Attribute’, OR In the home ribbon, select ‘case classification’, then ‘new attribute’.\nIn the ‘General’ tab, enter the name (‘2015 pre-election’) and a description, then move to the ‘Values’ tab.\n\n\nAssign Values for the attribute (‘values’ tab)\nClick ‘Add’ -&gt; enter ‘Yes’ Click ‘Add’ -&gt; enter ‘No’\nSelect ‘OK’ /done\nN.B. default is set to ‘unassigned’ – you can change this depending on your preference\n\nNow this column will appear as the last column in your case classifications sheet.
