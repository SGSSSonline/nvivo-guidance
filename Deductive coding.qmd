### Question codes - deductive coding 

Another basic form of *deductive* coding is to use the interview questions themselves. It might be useful to know how everyone answered the same question across different transcripts. 

You can view the interview questions and their suggested codes by going into the 'Research tools' folder and opening up '2016 Interview Questions':

### Creating code categories- manual approach 

#### Set up codes based on question headers 

- Keeping this file open in our Detail View, click on ‘codes’ in the Navigation View.

- Create a new code by right-clicking in the List View section (currently empty) 

- Click ‘new code’ 

![](Images/New code 1.png)

- In the pop up box, create codes from the terms in the right-hand column, one at a time. E.g. first off, make a code called 'Intro'. 

- For this example, select ‘aggregate coding from children’ when creating codes. This means that subcodes under this code will be included when expanding this code and returned in queries using the parent code. This can be changed at any time.

- Repeat the steps for all the question codes until your list view looks like this:

> N.B. As we haven’t begun coding, both files and references will show as 0. Once we begin coding, the number under files will tell how many distinct files contain this code. References will tell the number of total times this code has been used (codes may be used several times in the same file).

#### Code text manually to these question headers 

For example, 

- Open the first file in the folder 2016 interviews

- Find the question header 'Voting decision'.

- Highlight the text response within this section and drag and drop it into the code listed on the left.

> N.B. Some headings may have a digit after them if it’s a code that’s occurring for a second time. E.g. there may be a ‘Referendum campaign 2’ heading. You could choose to make another coding category for this, but here we decided to code them all together into ‘Referendum campaign’

### Creating code categories- autocoding approach 


Once again, this task is incredibly repetitive and is well suited to automation. 

As before, you must ensure transcripts are **appropriately formatted** to take advantage of autocoding. 

Make sure that all question headers (e.g. Voting Decision’) are formatted in MS Word using the same style (e.g. heading 1’) . You are best to do this before uploading the documents to Nvivo.
