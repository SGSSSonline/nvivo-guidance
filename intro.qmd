The introductory sessions are led by [Dr Katy Keenan](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geography-sustainable-development/people/klk4/); we will work through some basic tasks: 

- setting up a new Nvivo project 
- organising materials
- creating [cases](https://help-nv.qsrinternational.com/20/win/Content/cases/cases.html) and [case classifications](https://help-nv.qsrinternational.com/20/win/Content/classifications/about-classifications.html)
- manual coding 
- some autocoding features 

The 'Going further' sessions are led by [Alasdair Stewart](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/staff/alasdairstewart/) and will move to more advanced features and the flexible ways these can be used for qualitative analysis.  

Students will learn how to use some more advanced features of NVivo:

- coding workflows, tip and tricks
- different types of queries
- framework matrices

We will use some curated open access qualitative data (the Qualitative Election Study of Britain). However, there is an opportunity to discuss how to use NVivo to manage your own project.
