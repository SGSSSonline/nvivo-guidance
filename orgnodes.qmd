## Adding Organisation Codes

![](images/codes-1.png)

- Go to the main 'Codes' folder.
- Right-click on any white space and select 'New Code...'

![](images/codes-2.png)

- Provide it with a suitable name, such as 'Organisation Codes'
- I have added "z - ..." at the start as that ensure it's placed at the end when alphabetically ordered.

![](images/codes-3.png)

- Drag and drop the existing 'quotable quote' code to become a child code of 'z - Organisation Codes'.
- (Optional) rename it to 'Gold'.
- Create another two child codes 'Unsure' and 'Example'.

## Different organisation codes

![](images/codes-4.png)

There are various different codes researchers make to to help with organising their coding. A few examples:

- **Example** - Use for coding sections that are serve as illustrative example of another code.
- **Gold** - Use for coding sections that have high probability of later being used as a quote. (Though ensure to avoid cherry-picking!)
- **Important** - Use for coding sections that are important for the analysis. (This can be distinct in many cases from 'Gold'.)
- **Unsure** - Use for coding sections that are coded to another code, but you are unsure whether either it is right code for the section or this coded section is making you question the overall code.

**IMPORTANT** - You do not need all of these! This is merely showing range of examples. Which and how many to have wil change based on personal preferences and analysis aims. For example, when working as part of a large team, 'example' can be useful for researchers to identify coded sections they think illustrate specific codes they are developing. This can then help inform discussion to agree a share coding schema for the project.

Another way to use codes for organising is having codes to store excerpts you intend to use / have used in specific articles or thesis chapters. This can be combined with queries as well to aid finding most relevant sections. For example, a Matrix Coding Query with your writing organisation codes with your main coding schema.

Due to the much more niche use-case for these codes, they are definitely ones to chuck in their own folder to avoid cluttering the top-level folder.

:::

### Code Matrix Query

First:

- Select two or three existing codes from the top-level Codes folder or 'Autocoded (Theme)' sub-folder.
- Open tabs for to view the code results for each.
- Quickly go through coding sections from the code results to 'Example', 'Gold', and 'Unsure'.

![](images/cm-1.png)

- Go to the Query Criteria folder
- Right-click and select New Query
- and, Matrix Coding Query

![](images/cm-2.png)

- Rows = the regular codes you chose.
- Columns = Gold, Unsure, and Example.
- Hit 'Run Query'
- Remember to also 'Save Criteria...'

This will then produce a coding matrix you can then use to find sections coded at both a regular and organisation code.

## Memo Links

![](images/mem-1.png)

Create a linked memo for one of your chosen regular codes:

- Right-click the code.
- Select 'Memo Link'.
- Then 'Link to New Memo...'

![](images/mem-2.png)

Provide an appropriate name. For memos linked to codes I tend to go with "m - Code Name" naming convention.

![](images/mem-3.png)

- Add headers for 'Example', 'Gold',' Unsure'.

You can then use the coding matrix results to read through content coded to both the code and the three organisation nodes. (Or, for time, add some lorem ipsum.)

### Memo See Also Links

It is possible to link text within a file to text within a memo.

![](images/mem-4.png)

- Select the text you want to link to the memo text.
- Right-click and select 'Copy'.

![](images/mem-5.png)

Back in the memo:

- Select the memo text you want to be linked.
- Right-click and select 'Paste as See-Also Link'.

![](images/mem-6.png)

See also links appear in red highlighting and, similar to Annotations, a panel listing all See-Also Links within the current tab can be displayed at the bottom of the page.

![](images/mem-7.png)

Importantly, if you right-click red highlighted text or any of the items listed in the See-Also Links panel, you can 'Open To Item'. This will open a new tab for the file that contains the linked text, and will auto-scroll to the exact section the linked text appears.

### Autocode Memos 

As an example of how flexible some of NVivos tools are, as with files, it is possible to autocode memos.

![](images/acm-1.png)

- Right-click the memo you created.
- Select 'Autocode...'

![](images/acm-2.png)

![](images/acm-3.png)

![](images/acm-4.png)

![](images/acm-5.png)

1. Change 'Under' to 'New Folder'
2. Provide it an appropriate Name
3. Hit 'Finish'

![](images/acm-6.png)

This may not seem like much with just a single memo, but if you had a series of structure memos this would let you quickly find and navigate them by specific sections.

## Static Sets

Going through the 'Unsure' sections, for example, may help you identify new code to create or ones to replace. 

Say you decided to create three new codes to outright replace three old ones, but this is made tricky as the each code does replace one code, but instead cuts across content in 2-3 of the old codes.

This is where static sets come in handy.

- Add three existing Codes to the static set.
- Within your 'Codes' top-level folder create three new codes of your choice, for simplicity I'm just going with 'A', 'B', 'C'.
- Add these to the 'New Codes' static set.

### Coded to Old Codes, but not New Codes

![](images/not.png)

- Create a new Matrix Coding Query.
- Rows = 'Old Codes' static set.
- Columns = 'New Codes' static set.
- Change 'Coding at rows ... columns' to **Not**.
- 'Run Query'

This will create a single cell, double-clicking will open a coding results tab with all sections coded at the codes in the 'Old Codes' static set.

You can now work your way recoding to the New Codes. **Importantly**, during recoding you can hit 'Run Query' and get an update of how many sections are left to recode. This can be extremely useful you whilst recoding you realise you actually need a fourth new code 'D'. You can create it, add it to 'New Codes' static set and 'Run Query' for your 'Recoding Old with New' Matrix Code Query.

![](images/codingcontext.png)

Remember you can change the 'coding content' to view more text surrounding the sections coded to your old codes. That won't make a difference for most of the codes in this project file, but if you only coded sentences or even short phrases, this will add back some additional context.

![](images/staticstripe.png)

Similarly, you can turn on coding stripes and highlighting using the static set as a filter.

![](images/staticfix.png)

This can save a lot of headaches and frustration when if adopting a coding approach that have multiple stages in developing and refinding your codes or working on a large project with multiple researchers coding across different policy areas where you have a lot of codes across multiple folders that you may want retrieve quickly.

### Other uses for static sets

- Grouping conceptual related codes outside your main coding schema.
- Collating a mix of items (files, cases, codes) that are pertinent to an aspect of your analysis.
- Making a group of participants with similar experiences, but where it would not necessarily make sense to capture it using Attributes.
